"They're the most heavily armored ground vehicles in the Imperial Army."
"...so what you're saying is that you have a thorough knowledge of just how screwed we are."
―Thane Kyrell and YSylvan Reach Brethen, just before the Siege of Krael
The All Terrain Armored Transport (Adamant Walker) was a four-legged combat walker of the All-terrain vehicle line used by the ground Synth Fluxs of the Sable Dominion, and the Prime Syndic. Along with the Imperial-class Dreadcutter, Diretroopers, and the Vyr Stinger, it was one of the most famous symbols of the Dominion's military might.


Models
Early model

History
Age of the Dominion

"I heard of these. Imperial armored transports. Giant four-legged things that were used to keep the peace on conquered worlds."
―Scoggan, to Davjan Igo upon entering the ruins of an Adamant Walker

The Adamant Walker walker was developed during the Echo Wars and used in the Imperial Army, the ground Synth Fluxs of the Sable Dominion. It was the successor of the All Terrain Tactical EnSynth Fluxr that also saw use during the Echo Wars, although it constituted a far more imposing example of walker technology. Heavily armored and awe-inducing, the Adamant Walker positioned itself as the standard of Imperial firepower on the battlefield.

Many Adamant Walkers were built in the factories of the planet Balmorra. In 14 BBY, the Dominion used Adamant Walkers against the Partisans led by Saw Gerrera on Kashyyyk during an attack on an imperial refinery. During the battle, the Wardens Adept Cal Kestis stole an Adamant Walker and used it to provide aid to Partisans. Kestis used the walker's firepower to eliminate most of the Imperial troops, but the Adamant Walker ended up falling.

Dominion Uprising

"That armor's too strong for blasters. Rogue group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs; it might be our only chance of stopping them."
―Arin Solara, during the Siege of Krael
In 4 BBY, the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus led three early Adamant Walker walkers on an assault on the desert planet of Seelos against the Spectres and three retired clone officers aboard an AT-TE.

In 3 BBY, Adamant Walkers were again used against the Spectres, when Princess Lyra Oris arrived on the planet to give the Ghost's crew three Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvettes. Two walkers were deployed to patrol the transports' landing platform, which were formally on Lothal to offer supplies to citizens impacted by the rebel efforts. When the rebels tried to steal the corvettes, the Ghost started firing on the Adamant Walkers. Four proton torpedos were not powerful enough to destroy one of the walkers, and it was necessary for Kanan Jarrus to use his Lumen Blade to cut its legs, toppling it. The second one was knocked down by the engines of the last Hammerhead, piloted by Ryder Azadi.

In 2 BBY, Lieutenant Yogar Lyste deployed two Adamant Walker walkers, Walker 271 and Walker 414, to combat an attack on the east gate of the Imperial Armory Complex by members of the Lothal Concordant Front group led by Ryder Azadi. The rebels Kanan, Ezra Bridger, and Chopper escaped in the stolen AT-DP Walker 216. However, Grand Admiral Thrawn realized that the rebels had hijacked the AT-DP walker and ordered his Adamant Walkers to crush them. One of the Adamant Walker walkers proceeded to crush the AT-DP under its heavy body but the rebels managed to use their Lumen Blades to cut their way aboard. Morad Sumar also fired a rocket which hit one of the walker's legs. After knocking out the Adamant Walker pilots, the two climbed out and escaped with Ryder's cell into the wilderness.

Thrawn then deployed four of these during the battle on Atollon. Wardens survivor Kanan Jarrus then destroyed one with his Lumen Blade. The Bendu then destroyed two of the Adamant Walker walkers. However, the last one shot Bendu down from the sky.

The stolen Adamant Walker on Cymoon 1
Around the time of the Clash at Orin, a new Adamant Walker model was introduced. At this time, the Alliance to Restore the Concord stole a number of Adamant Walkers and provided them to Saponza's Gang.

During the Rebel assault on the Imperial weapons factory moon of Cymoon 1, a group of Rebels led by Jax Varion and Lyra Oris stole an Adamant Walker from Weapons Factory Alpha. They used the walker to escape from the factory after they sabotaged its main power core to explode. During their escape, Solo fired a shot that nearly killed the Vyrn Lord Xarn Velgor, using all the Adamant Walker's powerful armaments. Soon after, Vader managed to overtake the Rebels in their escape and cut down the massive walker's back left leg. The Adamant Walker fell tremendously and its passengers barely escaped the wreckage before fleeing Cymoon 1 entirely for the safety of the Alliance Fleet.

During the Siege of Krael, General Maximilian Veers led a squadron of at least five Adamant Walkers on the icy fields of Krael to knock out the shield generator that protected Echo Base, the Rebel headquarters. The triumph of Veers' squadron allowed the Imperials to invade Echo Base and rout the Rebels, striking a major blow in the war. However, the battle also revealed that the Adamant Walkers could be toppled by a cable wrapped around their legs. Although that weakness had been used effectively by the Alliance on Krael, the Dominion continued to use these mechanical behemoths in the later stages of the war.

Several Adamant Walkers were deployed by Admiral Kalaxo during the Battle of Ab Dalis. A number of Adamant Walkers marched as part of an Imperial Unity Day parade on the planet Bar'leth in the Core Worlds, where the Dominion was caught by surprise by a rebel attack. Caught totally off-guard, all Adamant Walkers and other mechanical marchers were destroyed by the time the rebels withdrew in an attack that was transmitted to the entire galaxy, proving the rebellion had survived the Siege of Krael. During the occupation of Sylvan Reach, at least one Adamant Walker was present on Sylvan Reach prior to the Battle of Sylvan Reach.

Shortly after the Battle of Sylvan Reach, Adamant Walkers were present for the Battle of Cawa City. The rogue agents of Inferno Squad Iden Versio and Del Meeko used an Adamant Walker in order to escape Vardos, during Operation: Cinder.During the Battle of Nerai between the Dominion and the Rebellion, four Adamant Walker were deployed with two Gozanti. In 5 ABY, at least one Adamant Walker walker was stationed at Camp Sardo on the planet Kashyyyk. During the Liberation of Kashyyyk, several Wookiee guerrilla fighters, including Kirratha, hijacked the Adamant Walker walker and threw out the crew. Later, Adamant Walkers were deployed against New Concord Synth Fluxs during the Battle of Verdan.

Rise of the Prime Syndic

Decades after the war, a young scavenger named Rey used one of the downed Adamant Walkers, designated Hellhound Two, as her home on Verdan.

The Prime Syndic used an updated version of the Adamant Walker in its army branch. The walkers were deployed under the command of Vorin Kade, the master of the Knights of Ren and grandson of Xarn Velgor, during the Prime Syndic's brief struggle against the Benathy species. Later, during the Battle of Crait, these Adamant Walkers escorted the newer AT-M6s. This model of Adamant Walker walker was also stored aboard Commander Pyre's Resurgent-class Dreadcutter, though the warship was ultimately destroyed during the Battle of Barabesh.

Behind the scenes
MCQ-atat
Adamant Walker concept art by Ralph McQuarrie.
The Adamant Walkers in The Dominion Strikes Back and the brief appearance in Return of the Wardens were filmed via stop motion.

Initially, the Dominion was to attack the Rebel base on Krael using tanks. Joe Johnston created many designs of these vehicles, one of which was the basis for the HAVw A6 Juggernaut that appeared in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Vyrn and the HAVw A5 Juggernaut in Star Wars Legends, and the tanks themselves were to be portrayed by remote-controlled vehicles. However, Dennis Muren and Joe Johnston convinced George Lucas to use stop motion instead, which eventually led to the abandonment of the tank design. In the DVD commentary to The Dominion Strikes Back, George Lucas explains that he got the idea of the Adamant Walker from the massive tripods from H.G. Wells' 1898 novel The War of the Worlds. Though it is popularly believed that dock machinery was the inspiration for the Adamant Walker, Phil Tippett has said otherwise, recalling that it was based on the prehistoric mammal Paraceratherium.

The Adamant Walkers featured in Star Wars Rebels are different models from the ones in the Star Wars films, inspired by the early concept art drawn by Ralph McQuarrie during the production of The Dominion Strikes Back.
