C-3PO

"We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life."
―C-3PO
C-3PO (See-Threepio) was a 3PO-series protocol droid designed to interact with organics, programmed primarily for etiquette and protocol. Sometimes referred to as Threepio, he was fluent in over six million forms of communication, and developed a fussy and worry-prone personality throughout his many decades of operation. Along with his counterpart, the astromech droid R2-D2, C-3PO constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of galactic history, and aided in saving the galaxy on many occasions.

C-3PO was rebuilt from spare parts by Anakin Skywalker, an enslaved human who lived in Mos Espa, a city on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. During the Clone Wars, he would serve the Naboo Senator Padmé Amidala. Shortly after the Clone Wars, C-3PO's memory was erased, though R2-D2's memory was not. C-3PO and R2-D2 were assigned to the Alderaan cruiser Tantive IV, where they served senator Bail Organa for nineteen years, assisting in his fledgling resistance movement against the Galactic Empire. At some point during this time, C-3PO's right leg was fitted with mismatched plating.

C-3PO remained constant companions with R2, and in 0 BBY, the pair became embroiled in the Galactic Civil War when Leia Organa of the Rebel Alliance entrusted them to bring a copy of the Death Star plans to the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine. After meeting Skywalker's son, Luke and the smuggler Han Solo, the droids helped rescue Princess Leia from the Empire's Death Star. They became directly attached to the three humans, helping them and their rebellion defeat the Empire and restore freedom to the galaxy, most notably when he convinced the Ewoks to aid the Rebels at the Battle of Endor.

Following the Battle of Endor, C-3PO continued serving the Skywalkers and Solo during the time of the New Republic. About thirty years after the events on Endor, C-3PO was still an aide to Organa, who had become a general in the Resistance, a private military group opposed to the First Order, a military junta that emulated the Old Empire. By that time, C-3PO was fitted with a new set of gold plating, which had a more symmetrical design than his previous coverings, with the exception of his head. His new coverings included a third finger joint, and a torso that was not a slim as it used to be. Because of his new plating, he no longer had a mismatched right lower leg. Although, he did end up wearing a red left arm for a very short time. By that time, C-3PO's language database had also been updated so that he could understand and communicate in over seven million different forms of communication, including ancient Sith dialects. He would assist Rey in translating Sith writings in order to locate Darth Sidious and the Sith Eternal's fleet, the Final Order, on Exegol, allowing his memory to be wiped in order to carry out the task. However, his friend R2 backed up a large portion of his memories, and after the Resistance defeated Sidious and the Sith Eternal in the Battle of Exegol, his memory was restored.

Early incarnation

"Oh, might I remind you, sir, I was once protocol droid to the chief negotiator for the entire Manakron system."
―C-3PO
In an early incarnation, C-3PO served as a protocol droid to the chief negotiator for the Manakron system. Additionally, he later claimed that his first job was programming binary loadlifters, which he said were very similar to moisture vaporators in most respects.

Serving the Maker

"He's perfect."
―Padmé Amidala after meeting C-3PO
At some point, however, C-3PO was seriously damaged and his vital components were left behind on a junk pile on Tatooine. Anakin Skywalker, a slave boy from the Tatooinian city of Mos Espa, collected scrap parts and started rebuilding C-3PO in 34 BBY so the droid would help his mother. As Anakin longed for a life far from Tatooine and explore the galaxy, he hoped to have C-3PO as his and his mother's faithful companion so they would be able to venture the galaxy one day and understand and understood the languages of the natives they could come across with, given C-3PO's capability of millions of communication forms. Although protocol droids were normally designed for light duty in luxurious environments, Skywalker specially modified C-3PO so he could withstand Tatooine's sand and heat. C-3PO served Anakin and his mother Shmi by performing household chores. During his time with Skywalker and Shmi, C-3PO's parts and wiring were left exposed since Skywalker was unable to outfit him with an outer covering due to droid plating being too expensive.

Following the Trade Federation's invasion of the Mid Rim planet of Naboo, C-3PO's life entered a new chapter when his owner Anakin met several off-worlders at the shop of his owner, the Junk dealer Watto, and then invited them to seek shelter at his home during a sandstorm. The Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, the Queen of Naboo Padmé Amidala, the Gungan Jar Jar Binks, and the astromech droid R2-D2 were brought to the slave quarters that Anakin shared with his mother Shmi. As a result of this invitation, Amidala and R2-D2 were introduced to C-3PO. Anakin plugged in one of C-3PO's photoreceptors, which became the first time C-3PO had experienced sight. Upon meeting R2-D2, C-3PO was shocked when the candid astromech droid commented that he was "naked." Despite the exchange, the two droids fast developed a friendship of sorts, working together to help Skywalker make final adjustments to his podracer in time to race it in the Boonta Eve Classic race. While working on the podracer, the two droids discussed space travel and noted the clumsy actions of Binks.

On the day of the race, C-3PO represented his owner in the opening flag parade, carrying Skywalker's flag onto the course prior to the start of the race. He then stood on the sidelines with R2-D2 and two of Skywalker's playmates, Kitster Banai and Wald, who cheered their friend on. Skywalker won the race, which, thanks to a deal that Jinn had struck with Watto, earned the boy his freedom from slavery and secured Jinn the hyperdrive generator he needed to leave the planet. As Skywalker prepared to depart Tatooine, he said his goodbyes to C-3PO, apologizing for not having completed the droid's construction, and expressing his wishes that Shmi wouldn't sell him.

Beyond Tatooine

"There's been some terrible mistake. I'm programmed for etiquette, not destruction!"
―C-3PO during the Battle of Geonosis
Later, his owner Shmi was sold to the moisture farmer Cliegg Lars, who freed and married her. Shmi brought C-3PO along with her, and the protocol droid found himself in the service of the Lars family, who owned a moisture farm in the Jundland Wastes. Shmi covered him in a tarnished grey plating to shield him from Tatooine's sandy environment. Ten years after his parting with Anakin Skywalker, Shmi was kidnapped by a group of Tusken Raiders, fearsome nomads native to Tatooine's desert wastes. Sensing his mother's pain and anguish through the Force, Anakin returned with his secret lover and childhood friend Padmé Amidala to find his mother. Skywalker had advanced in his Jedi training as a Padawan under the tutelage of Obi-Wan Kenobi, while Amidala had become a Senator in the Galactic Senate.

When Skywalker and Amidala visited the Lars' moisture farm, they found C-3PO working on a moisture vaporator. He initially didn't recognize Skywalker until the latter finished his name for him when introducing himself. Greeting his Maker, C-3PO discovered that Skywalker had come in search of his mother, and brought the two guests into the homestead's courtyard, where they were met by Cliegg Lars, as well as his son, Owen Lars and his girlfriend, Beru Whitesun. Learning of his mother's peril, Skywalker took Owen's speeder bike to find her, and soon returned with her corpse, having recovered it from a Tusken village. C-3PO was present when he arrived, and later attended a funeral for Shmi on the farm's property. When R2-D2, who had been waiting aboard Amidala's nearby yacht, interrupted the funeral with an urgent message for the Padawan, C-3PO translated the astromech's binary beeps and whistles. After viewing the holocomm message, Skywalker and Amidala departed Tatooine for Geonosis to rescue Skywalker's Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, taking Threepio with them.

Thus, C-3PO would become both a witness and participant in the subsequent First Battle of Geonosis, the first spark of the Clone Wars, a conflict that would change the course of galactic history. After landing on Geonosis, C-3PO reluctantly followed R2-D2, Skywalker, and Amidala into the Geonosian droid foundry. After being trapped in the factory's conveyor belt system, C-3PO's head was separated from his body and grafted onto the chassis of a B1-series battle droid. Meanwhile, a B1 battle droid head was inserted onto Threepio's body. During the ensuing battle, both of C-3PO's "bodies" were knocked out during the fighting. Fortunately for him, he was promptly reattached to his rightful body by R2-D2. Following the events on Geonosis, C-3PO and R2-D2 travelled to Naboo with Skywalker and Amidala for the two to be married in Naboo's Lake Country.

In the days following the Geonosis battle and before the wedding, C-3PO was determined to keep Skywalker and Amidala out of each other's sight until the wedding itself. Whilst waiting for the ceremony, Amidala believed there was a high chance Skywalker was biding his time by working on C-3PO, as the droid needed to be cleaned after the sands of Tatooine had years to get into his joints, only to be further dirtied by the sands of Geonosis. As such, the protocol unit needed to receive a cleaning before he could receive his yet-to-be-finished new plating. Despite C-3PO's attempts, the two humans did see each other before the wedding, as Amidala, per a request from Queen Jamillia of Naboo, needed the help of R2-D2 and Skywalker to rescue the Torada Collective from the Separatist planet Nooroyo. After completing the mission, they returned to the Lake House to be wed, with C-3PO and R2-D2 in attendance.

The Clone Wars

Serving Senator Amidala

During the Clone Wars, C-3PO would serve Senator Padmé Amidala, the spouse of Anakin Skywalker, and was given a shiny gold-colored plating to better suit his new role. On one occasion, Amidala was captured by Jabba's uncle Ziro during a mission to reopen communications with the Hutts after Jabba's son Rotta was kidnapped by the Separatist leader Count Dooku. Amidala contacted C-3PO, who in turn contacted the Coruscant Guard, which promptly raided Ziro's Palace and freed Amidala. Meanwhile, Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano managed to rescue Rotta and return him safely to his father. C-3PO and his comrades' actions help the Republic win over Jabba, who later signed a favorable treaty with them.

Following the Rotta affair, C-3PO accompanied Senator Amidala on a mission to contact the InterGalactic Banking Clan's executive, who purportedly wanted to sue for peace. Their planned rendezvous was a point of space near the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center. Unknown to the two of them, this was a trap concocted by Darth Sidious and his apprentice Count Dooku. The Separatist military commander General Grievous's flagship Malevolence had been damaged during a recent space battle and was unable to enter hyperspace. The Sith and Separatists hoped to use Senator Amidala as a hostage to extract leverage from the Republic commander Skywalker, who was pursuing the Malevolence.

Amidala's vessel was trapped in the Separatist warship's tractor beam, but they broke free by exploding their vessel's engines. C-3PO and Amidala then sneaked aboard and contacted Skywalker for help. Skywalker along with Kenobi and R2-D2 boarded the Malevolence and made arrangements to rendezvous with C-3PO and the Senator at the warship's rail jet system. However, they were accosted by battle droids there, which prompted Amidala to shove C-3PO into a moving hovertrain. After the battle droids were neutralized, Kenobi began levitating C-3PO to safety, but the floating droid was hit full-on by a moving hover train, which was only halted when R2-D2 sliced into a computer terminal and shut it down. The sudden stop launched C-3PO onto a nearby platform, where he quickly regained his bearings and again began wandering the cruiser's corridors before being located by R2-D2. Together, the two droids escaped the Malevolence before the Separatist warship crashed into a nearby moon after being sabotaged by Skywalker.

Mission to Rodia

Following their adventures on the Malevolence, C-3PO along with Senator Amidala and the Gungan Representative Jar Jar Binks traveled to Rodia to meet with her old friend Senator Onaconda Farr. Amidala's mission was to ensure that the ailing Rodians remained loyal to the Galactic Republic. While Threepio and Binks remained with Amidala's yacht on the landing platform, Senator Amidala went to meet Farr. An ill-fated attempt to contact local swamp creatures ended with some fruit being thrown into C-3PO's face. Unknown to Amidala, Farr had already struck a deal with the Separatist leader Viceroy Nute Gunray of the Trade Federation.

C-3PO and Binks were soon confronted by several B1 battle droids. During the ensuing confrontation, Threepio became stuck to a magnetic hoist that collided with the Separatist battle droids, throwing them into the water below. While attempting to take off, Binks accidentally destroyed the yacht with the magnetic hoist. Threepio remained stuck to the hoist due to his metallic body, but Binks along with the yacht fell into the water below. C-3PO believed that Binks perished during the accident. However, Binks resurfaced and promptly released C-3PO from the hoist. While scouring through the wrecked yacht, Binks found and donned a Jedi robe.

Shortly, the two of them were separated again, and Threepio was captured by Separatist droids, who were ordered to march him to a dismantling center. However, C-3PO was rescued by Amidala, who destroyed his captors. She ordered C-3PO to send a distress signal to nearby Republic forces. Threepio succeeded in sending for help before being arrested by two more Separatist droids. Gunray then attempted to execute both Amidala and C-3PO but was foiled by Binks, who returned with a Kwazel Maw monster, which disposed of the Separatist droids. Senator Farr then turned on Gunray and arrested him, revealing that his collaboration with the Separatists had been a ruse to lure the Viceroy into a trap. Republic forces arrived on Rodia and promptly apprehended Gunray. Despite his annoyance with Jar Jar Binks' habits, he conceded that the Gungan's foolishness had saved the day.

Mission to Orto Plutonia

Later, C-3PO and R2-D2 accompanied Skywalker, Kenobi, and Captain Rex on a mission to investigate the disappearance of a clone trooper force on the icy planet of Orto Plutonia. Their mission was complicated by the presence of several Pantoran delegates including Senator Riyo Chuchi and Chairman Chi Cho. The Pantorans claimed territorial sovereignty over Orto Plutonia even though it was supposedly devoid of sentient life. After discovering the dead clone troopers, the Jedi and Republic mission also discovered that a nearby Separatist base had been destroyed. They quickly deduced that a third force had been responsible for these two attacks.

Later, Skywalker and Kenobi discovered that Ord Plutonia was home to a species of primitive bipedal sentient beings called the Talz. After some difficulties, Kenobi and Skywalker established contact with the Talz and assured them that they had come in peace. The Talz chieftain Thi-Sen wanted the Republic to leave his people in peace and to withdraw their presence from the planet. After the Jedi had made contact with the Talz tribe, C-3PO and Cho joined them in meeting with Thi-Sen. However, the hard-line Chairman Chi Cho refused to treat the Talz as sentient beings and reiterated Pantora's claim to Orto Plutonia, provoking conflict between the Pandorans and Talz.

The Jedi ended the fighting by convincing Senator Chuchi to contact the Pantoran Assembly, which gave her the authority to negotiate peace with the Talz and to relieve Chairman Cho of his authority. C-3PO and his companions then accompanied Senator Chuchi to the scene of the fighting. There, C-3PO helped Chuchi to broker a truce with Thi-Sen, ending the Pandoran-Talz conflict. As a result of the fighting, the Pandorans ceded sovereignty over Plutonia to the Talz.

The Blue Shadow Virus crisis

"With your permission, Senator Padmé, I would like to shut down before I get sensory overload."
"Permission denied."
―C-3PO and Amidala, while analyzing a captured Separatist tactical droid on Naboo
Following the discovery of a scouting party of Separatist battle droids on Naboo, C-3PO accompanied Senator Amidala and Representative Binks back to Naboo. Amidala had been summoned by Queen Neeyutnee, who wanted to procure more military aid from the Republic. C-3PO questioned a captured T-series tactical droid, which had its photoreceptors removed. After convincing the droid that it was aboard a Separatist starship, C-3PO gleaned that there was a secret Separatist facility on Naboo producing some sort of virus before Jar Jar Binks accidentally destroyed the droid. Despite this setback, Binks and Amidala discovered a slug-beetle and mud from a swamp, which led them to Naboo's Eastern swamps.

While Threepio stayed behind on Theed with Captain Gregar Typho to examine data from the captured Separatist droids, Amidala and Binks ventured into the swamps and discovered a secret Separatist research facility headed by the scientist Doctor Nuvo Vindi. Vindi was developing a deadly bioweapon called the Blue Shadow Virus for the Separatists. C-3PO and Typho discovered a hologram of Dr. Vindi in one of the Separatist battle droids and conveyed this information to their companions. With the aid of a local Gungan farmer named Peppi Bow, Skywalker, Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano, and several clone troopers, Amidala and Skywalker succeeded in apprehending Dr. Vindi and stopping him from releasing his bioweapon.

The Senate hostage crisis

When Senator Amidala was organizing a party for Senator Aang, she sent Threepio and R2-D2 to buy some jogan fruit that Artoo had forgotten to buy for garnishing the jogan fruitcake, Aang's favorite dessert. In the lower market districts, the two droids grumbled and C-3PO was swindled by a fruit vendor. Following the purchase, another droid approached C-3PO and R2-D2 and suggested that they visit Droid Spa for a cosmetic overhaul. While R2-D2 visited the facility, C-3PO was kidnapped by the Separatist-aligned Duros bounty hunter Cad Bane's droid henchmen, Todo 360 and HELIOS-3E.

Threepio was taken to Bane's hideout in an industrial district on Coruscant, where his databanks were scanned for information on the Senate Building's layout. While C-3PO's databank yielded no such information, he mentioned that his astromech counterpart R2-D2 might have the information. Bane's droid henchmen promptly kidnapped R2-D2 and brought him to Bane. After Bane extracted the necessary information from Artoo's databanks, he ordered that the two droids be given a memory wipe and returned to the place where they had been snatched.

Following the unpleasant shopping trip, C-3PO and R2-D2 returned to Amidala with their purchase. Both droids were completely unaware of what had befallen them. The jogan fruit was added to Senator Aang's dessert, as planned. Meanwhile, Bane delivered the plans from Artoo's memory banks to Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine. The Hutt crime lord ordered Bane to free his uncle Ziro from prison, since he knew information that would endanger the Hutts, who were nominally working with the Republic. Bane hatched a plan to rescue Ziro.

Following his kidnapping and mind-wipe, C-3PO and Senator Amidala were caught up in the Senate hostage crisis. Cad Bane and several other mercenaries infiltrated the Senate Building and took Amidala, Threepio, Skywalker and several senators hostage in a bid to force a pardon for the imprisoned Ziro. These senators had been meeting to discussed the proposed Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill. Despite the Republic honoring Bane's demands, Bane planted several explosives in the hall with the aim of killing the senators. Skywalker saved the day by using his lightsaber to cut a hole around the group, moments before the explosives went off.

The Separatist spy

C-3PO was briefly reunited with R2-D2 when the two droids accompanied their masters Senator Amidala and General Skywalker on a mission to Cato Neimoidia. The quartet were accompanying Rush Clovis, the representative from Scipio and a delegate representing the InterGalactic Banking Clan in the Senate. The Jedi Council suspected that Clovis was secretly spying for the Separatists and sent Skywalker and Amidala to spy on him. During the journey, C-3PO noticed Skywalker's hostile behavior towards Clovis, who was trying to flirt with his secret wife Amidala.

Upon arriving on Cato Neimoidia, the delegation was greeted by the Trade Federation's Senator Lott Dod, who tried unsuccessfully to force Clovis to lend more money for the Separatist cause. When Dod deduced that Clovis was infatuated with Senator Amidala, he arranged for her to be poisoned during a formal dinner. Despite this, Amidala succeeded in stealing a hologram disc which confirmed that Clovis was indeed working for the Separatists. After Amidala began to succumb to the effects of the poisoning, C-3PO and a 2-1B surgical droid attended to the Senator in her quarters.

Meanwhile, Clovis learned that Amidala was spying on him and went to confront her only to be cornered by Skywalker. Realizing that Skywalker loved Amidala, Clovis offered to get the antidote in return for receiving back the holodisk. C-3PO and his companions brought Amidala back to their ship but were cornered by Dod and his aides. Clovis attempted to bluff his way out, but Dod refused to let them leave. After Clovis pulled a blaster and forced Dod to hand over the antidote, C-3PO and his companions fled aboard Amidala's ship. They fled into space but left Clovis behind to face Dod alone.

Serving a peacemaker

As the Clone Wars dragged on, C-3PO continued serving Senator Amidala, who was becoming an active member of a group of Senators that supported diplomacy and opposed the expansion of the Grand Army of the Republic. On one occasion, C-3PO accompanied Senator Amidala and Master Kenobi when they presented evidence in the Galactic Senate that the planet Mandalore wished to be neutral. As a result, the Senate rescinded an earlier vote calling for a military occupation of Mandalore.

Later, Senator Amidala and her supporters including the Alderaanian Senator Bail Organa and the Rodian Senator Onaconda Farr proposed a bill calling for the reduction of military spending. C-3PO attended several meetings of this informal peace coalition in Senator Amidala's office. On one such occasion, C-3PO was serving drinks when Senator Farr suffered an apparent heart attack and died. Threepio and Amidala attended the funeral of Senator Farr. Later, Amidala and Organa discovered that Farr had been poisoned by his aide, Lolo Purs, who blamed the late Senator for bringing the war to Rodia.

The Zillo Beast

Following the Republic's victory at Malastare, Chancellor Palpatine ordered the Jedi Generals Windu and Skywalker to transport the Zillo Beast, a gargantuan monster that had been captured and sedated during the fighting. After learning that a lightsaber could not harm the beast, Palpatine enlisted the services of the scientist Sionver Boll to study the beast's scales in order to develop a new type of armor for the Grand Army. Palpatine also planned to kill the monster with Malastarian fuel after it had outlived its usefulness.

Senator Amidala learned about Palpatine's plan and arranged a meeting with Skywalker and Kenobi. During the meeting, C-3PO had another brief reunion with his astromech counterpart, R2-D2. Amidala succeeded in convincing her husband Skywalker and the delegation met with Chancellor Palpatine and Vice Chair Mas Amedda. However, the Zillo Beast escaped Boll's laboratory at the same time and proceeded to wreak havoc on the streets of Coruscant. Sensing that Palpatine was a Sith, the Zillo Beast made its way to the Galactic Senate building. C-3PO assisted in the evacuation of staff from the building and guided them to an executive ship that was piloted by a Senate Commando.

Before they could flee to safety, the ship was grabbed by the Zillo Beast, but Skywalker used his lightsaber to cleave the vessel in half, sending the bow along with C-3PO and the other passengers plummeting into the Senate Building. C-3PO hitched a ride aboard R2-D2, who had used a tow cable to attach himself to the other side of the building. However, R2-D2 was forced to rescue Chancellor Palpatine and activated his booster rockers, leaving C-3PO behind. The protocol droid lost hold of the cable and fell to the floor of the Senate building. Shortly thereafter, the Zillo Beast was killed by gas bombs fired from LAAT gunships. C-3PO survived the Zillo Beast incident and continued serving Senator Amidala.

Staying behind

"R2, look out! Behind you! You're being followed by battle droids!"
"These are your troops? They're battle droids."
"What do you mean they've been reprogrammed to follow your orders?"
―C-3PO and R2-D2
C-3PO stayed behind on Coruscant while R2-D2 accompanied Anakin Skywalker and Master Kenobi on a mission to rescue Jedi Master Even Piell from the Citadel prison on the planet Lola Sayu. C-3PO was initially alarmed when he saw R2-D2 flanked by three reprogrammed B1 battle droids. Threepio told R2-D2 not to get "uppity" about commanding new battle droids before parting company.

Mission to Aleen

"Hey Shiny! You two finished with those repairs on the computer system?"
"My good sir. You may not realize it, but we have been on quite an adventure."
―A clone trooper and C-3PO, while on Aleena
C-3PO and R2-D2 later took part in a mercy mission to the Mid Rim planet of Aleen, which was experiencing a series of catastrophic global earthquakes. C-3PO served as the translator for the Republic mission led by Clone Commander Wolffe while his astromech counterpart Artoo-Detoo was tasked with interfacing with the equipment. Threepio's arrival coincided with a brief aftershock during which he tried to calm the local villages. When the aftershock stopped, the Aleena thought that the golden droid was some sort of divine messenger and asked the Republic soldiers to put the earth to rest, a request that Wolffe reluctantly had to acquiesce to.

During the mission, C-3PO translated while Wolffe explained the function of the Republic's delivered supplies to the Aleena King Manchucho. Later, C-3PO accompanied R2-D2 and several clone troopers as they entered the local Republic communications station to survey and repair the damage caused by the earthquakes. There, the Aleena villagers led C-3PO and R2-D2 into a collapsed structure, which contained a huge golden seal embedded into the ground. The seal turned out to be the entrance to a tunnel that led to the subterranean regions of Aleen. When another earthquake struck the area, C-3PO and R2-D2 fell into the tunnel and were separated from the clone troopers.

While exploring the underground tunnels, C-3PO and R2-D2 encountered a species of sentient, tree-like beings called the Kindalo, who demanded that they leave since the surface dwellers "destroyed the peace." After C-3PO convinced the Kindalo that they bore no ill will and had come to help with the earthquakes, the Kindalo sent the droids to meet Orphne, a reptilian humanoid with mystical powers. Orphne told the two droids that a mutual balance had previously existed between the Aleena and the subterranean world. Since Aleena's atmosphere was toxic to them, the underground dwellers depended on a filtering process of the planet's soil that made the air breathable for them. The underground dwellers had set off this earthquake as a means of sealing the breach.

When C-3PO agreed to help fix the damage, Orphne gave the droids a parting riddle. R2-D2 quickly deduced that Orphne was referring to a river and used the water seal to activate a water spout that sent the two droids and the chamber's central floor plate back to the surface. The two droids landed at the opening where they were greeted by a chanting crowd of Aleena. Recalling the riddle, Threepio quickly realized that only he and R2-D2 were able to seal the breach, which was in fact the unsettled seal. Together, the two droids closed the seal and brought an end to Aleena's earthquakes. While Wolffe and his clone troopers were skeptical of their story, the two droids' efforts were greatly appreciated by the Aleena.

Further adventures

Following the events on Aleen, C-3PO and R2-D2 were caught up in a second adventure that took them to Patitite Pattuna, Balnab, and the pirate ship Marauder. While traveling aboard the Jedi Master Adi Gallia's Star Destroyer, their starship was attacked by three Separatist cruisers led by General Grievous. C-3PO and R2-D2 escaped the stricken vessel aboard a Y-wing starfighter and crash-landed on the nearby planet of Patitite Pattuna.

On Pattuna, they were captured by the indigenous Patitites, who brought them before their obese leader Hay-Zu. During their meeting, R2-D2 accidentally toppled the tyrannical overlord much to the joy of the Patitites, who released their prisoners and allowed the two droids to leave on their Y-wing. With their starfighter's power systems damage, C-3PO and R2-D2 landed on another planet called Balnab. The indigenous Balnabs captured the two droids and brought them before their leader, who turned out to be a holo-projection created by a group of rogue pit droids. These pit droids had enslaved the Balnabs. After R2-D2 exposed the scam, the Balnabs rebelled against their droid overlords.

C-3PO and R2-D2 took the opportunity to escape and resume their search for a replacement power unit for their Y-wing starfighter. Low on power, the two droids were captured by a band of Weequay pirates, who wanted to use them as gladiators. However, the Weequay's pirate ship Marauder was attacked by General Grievous' cruiser. During the bombardment, C-3PO and R2-D2 were sucked out of the Marauder by a hull-breach. R2-D2 used his rocket boosters to bring him and C-3PO aboard Grievous' ship. Grievous ordered the two droids to be melted down in his incinerator but they were rescued by a Republic fleet led by Master Plo Koon, who had come to rescue Master Gallia. C-3PO and R2-D2 were subsequently rescued by Plo Koon's forces and resumed their services to Senator Amidala and General Skywalker respectively.

Rise of the Empire

"I feel so helpless."
―C-3PO at the end of the Clone Wars
Following the Battle of Coruscant, C-3PO joined the Jedi Master Mace Windu and the Galactic Senate's Loyalist Committee in greeting R2-D2 and his Jedi companions Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi following their successful mission to rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who had been kidnapped by the Separatist General Grievous. C-3PO would continue serving Senator Amidala during the last days of the Galactic Republic and the Great Jedi Purge, which ushered in the Galactic Empire. He also accompanied his master to Mustafar and piloted the skiff, allowing some reprieve for Amidala, who was distraught at her husband's turn to the dark side of the Force and his role in the murder of Jedi younglings at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.

Unknown to him and Amidala, Skywalker's former Master Obi-Wan Kenobi had stowed aboard the skiff. On Mustafar, Kenobi's presence enraged Skywalker, who Force choked his wife. While Kenobi dueled his former Padawan, C-3PO and R2-D2 attended to the ailing Senator and brought her back aboard the skiff. After Kenobi defeated Skywalker, he and C-3PO piloted the skiff to Polis Massa, a remote Outer Rim world, where she gave birth to twins, a boy named Luke Skywalker and a daughter named Leia Organa, before passing away. While the Skywalker twins were spirited away to different locations to hide them from the Empire, C-3PO and R2-D2 passed into the ownership of Padmé's friend Bail Organa, the Senator for Alderaan. Due to Threepio's talkative nature, Senator Organa made arrangements for the protocol droid to receive a memory wipe in order to keep Leia's true parentage a secret.

Age of the Empire

Service to Bail Organa

R2-D2's solo mission

A year after the Clone Wars, C-3PO served aboard Senator Organa's CR90 corvette Tantive IV, which was captained by Captain Raymus Antilles. When R2-D2 returned from a solo mission to rendezvous with the former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano and bring her to Senator Organa, C-3PO berated his astromech companion. Following the evacuation of Raada, Ahsoka Tano subsequently joined Senator Organa's rebel movement and became the spymaster known as "Fulcrum."

9 years later, during Breha Organa's party for her sister's visit, C-3PO translated for the other guests.

Mission to Garel

"I am C-3PO and this is my counterpart, R2-D2. I was translating for Minister Tua when we were attacked by thieves like, uh, you."
―C-3PO, introducing himself to the Spectres
About five years before the Battle of Yavin, Senator Bail Organa sent C-3PO and his astromech counterpart R2-D2 to escort the Imperial Minister Maketh Tua and the Aqualish arms dealer Amda Wabo to the planet Garel. Minister Tua wanted to obtain a shipment of T-7 ion disruptor rifles, illicit weapons which had been banned by the Imperial Senate following the brutal pacification of Lasan. She intended to mass-produce the weapons on Lothal, a formerly backwater Outer Rim world that had become a manufacturing base for the Empire. Since Tua could not speak the Aqualish language, C-3PO was assigned the job of acting as her translator. Unknown to C-3PO, but known to R2-D2, their true mission was to prevent the T-7 ion disruptors from falling into Imperial hands.

Upon arriving in Lothal, C-3PO and his companions boarded the Star Commuter 2000 shuttle ST-45, which ferried them to Garel. Unknown to C-3PO, members of a Lothalian rebel cell were also traveling on the shuttle. Two of rebels, the human teenager Ezra Bridger and the astromech droid Chopper created a noisy ruckus. Another rebel, the former Jedi Kanan Jarrus pretended to be irate and demanded that the petulant Chopper be sent to the back of the shuttle. The pilot complied, but in retaliation Bridger demanded that Tua's droids be sent to the back as well. Despite Tua's and C-3PO's protests, the protocol droid and his astromech counterpart were forced to move to the rear compartment.

Bereft of a translator, Tua was forced to turn to the Mandalorian girl Sabine Wren, who posed as an Imperial Academy student fluent in Aqualish. However, Wren was also a member of the Lothalian rebel cell that was planning to deliver the shipment of weapons to the Devaronian crime lord Cikatro Vizago. Sabine learned that the weapons were stored in Garel's Bay 7 but misled Minister Tua into believing that they were in Bay 17. After the shuttle landed in Garel's spaceport, C-3PO and R2-D2 accompanied Minister Tua and a force of stormtroopers to Bay 17. When they found nothing, C-3PO explained that Sabine might have accidentally mistranslated "Bay 7" as "Bay 17."

While traveling to Bay 7, C-3PO's counterpart R2-D2 was accosted by Chopper, who had been sent to distract the Imperials. Chopper rammed himself right into R2-D2, then shook his arm in apparent anger. In response, R2-D2 whipped out his electroshock prod, but did not use it as C-3PO ordered him to apologize. But Minister Tua recognized Chopper from the shuttle ride to Garel and ordered her stormtrooper guards to hurry to Bay 7. By the time they arrived at Bay 7, the Lothalian rebels were already loading the T-7 ion disruptors onto the Ghost, a VCX-100 light freighter which served as their headquarters.

A blaster fight broke out, and in the ensuing confusion C-3PO and R2-D2 fled aboard the Ghost, which fled into hyperspace. The two droids were then taken prisoner by the Lothalian rebels, who placed restraining bolts on both of them.

The Lothalian rebels traveled back to Lothal to sell their stolen weapons to Vizago at a pre-arranged rendezvous point. Despite his restraining bolts, C-3PO managed to used the ship's intercom to contact the Imperial authorities, telling that he and his astromech counterpart had been kidnapped by "criminals." The Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus answered his transmission and promised that "help" was on the way. Using C-3PO's transmission to trace the Ghost's coordinates, Agent Kallus brought an Imperial attack force consisting of a Gozanti-class cruiser, two AT-DP walkers, and several stormtroopers to the Lothalian rebels' meeting place. Mistaking the Imperials for "friends," C-3PO approached them but was fired upon and narrowly escaped disintegration. Meanwhile, R2-D2 helped the Lothalian rebels to overload and destroy the T-7 disruptors.

Following the brief skirmish, both droids and the rebels managed to escape their Imperial pursuers. The rebels also returned C-3PO and R2-D2 to their rightful owner, Senator Organa, who paid them some credits for destroying the weapons. Due to the stress of his adventures at Garel and Lothal, C-3PO requested that he be allowed to rest for a while, which the Senator obliged. Senator Organa then questioned R2-D2 about the Lothalian rebels.

Galactic Civil War

"Scarif? They're going to Scarif? Why does nobody ever tell me anything, R2?"
―C-3PO to R2-D2 as the Rebel Fleet leaves Yavin 4 for Scarif
During the Galactic Civil War, C-3PO was with R2-D2 at the Rebel Alliance's secret base on Yavin 4 at the time the Alliance Fleet prepared to leave for the Battle of Scarif to help reinforce Rogue One who had traveled to Scarif to retrieve the plans for the Galactic Empire's Death Star, a new superweapon capable of destroying entire worlds. C-3PO remarked how nobody told him anything.

Return to Tatooine

"We're doomed."
―C-3PO, as he is thrust into the Galactic Civil War
The Alliance succeeded in stealing the plans for the superweapon. C-3PO and R2-D2 were later aboard Senator Leia Organa's blockade runner, the Tantive IV, which was being pursued by Darth Vader's Imperial-class Star Destroyer, Devastator. Unbeknownst to C-3PO, Darth Vader was actually his former master, Anakin Skywalker. The Tantive IV was crippled by a laser blast from Vader's ship, and Imperial stormtroopers boarded the vessel. After Princess Leia managed to insert these secret plans and a holographic message for Master Kenobi into R2-D2, the two droids fled in an escape pod to the desert planet of Tatooine.

After quarreling in the Jundland Wastes, the two droids separated. During his walk, C-3PO walked beside the skeleton of a krayt dragon. Both were reunited onboard a sandcrawler, after being captured by Jawas, who sold them to a family of moisture farmers; C-3PO was chosen as a moisture vaporator programmer and for having Bocce among his languages, and recommended buying R2-D2 after the first chosen R5-D4 had a motivator malfunction. This family turned out to be Owen Lars, his wife Beru, and their adopted nephew Luke Skywalker, the son of Anakin Skywalker. While C-3PO settled down to his new home, R2-D2 wanted to continue his mission to find Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Unable to resolve their differences, R2-D2 escaped into the Jundland Wastes. Skywalker followed him in a landspeeder piloted by C-3PO and caught up with R2-D2. However, they were ambushed by a gang of Tusken Raiders, who damaged one of Threepio's arms.

C-3PO and his companions were rescued by Master Kenobi, who brought them to his dwelling. Kenobi revealed Skywalker's Jedi heritage and gave him his father's lightsaber, telling the boy that Anakin had been murdered by another apprentice named Darth Vader. After discovering Princess Leia's message in R2-D2's compartments, Kenobi attempted to persuade Luke to accompany him to Alderaan, Princess Leia's homeworld. Skywalker was initially reluctant until he discovered that Imperial stormtroopers had murdered his relatives and razed their moisture farm. Later, C-3PO and his companions traveled to the spaceport of Mos Eisley with the intention of finding passage to Alderaan.

Upon arriving in the settlement, they were stopped by a stormtrooper patrol. However, Kenobi used a Jedi mind trick to convince the stormtroopers to give them free passage through the town. Kenobi and Skywalker entered Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina and negotiated with the smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca, while Threepio and R2-D2, forced to wait outside, wandered the streets of Mos Eisley and narrowly evaded a stormtrooper patrol. Later, all four boarded Han Solo's ship, the Millennium Falcon, and fled into hyperspace.

Stopping the Death Star

"Hang on tight, R2. You've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?"
―C-3PO to R2, just before the Battle of Yavin
Upon exiting hyperspace in the Alderaan system, C-3PO and his companions discovered that the Empire's Death Star had already destroyed the planet. The Millennium Falcon was then trapped in the tractor beam of the Death Star. Hiding under the freighter's cargo compartments, they managed to ambush an Imperial scanning team and two stormtroopers. The rebels then seized control of an Imperial control room. While Threepio and R2-D2 stayed behind to watch the Falcon, the other rebels split into two groups. Disguised as stormtroopers, Skywalker and Solo along with their Wookiee "prisoner" Chewbacca went to Detention Block AA-23 to free Princess Leia. Meanwhile, Master Kenobi went to disable the tractor-beam projector.

Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca managed to free the Princess but ended up in a garbage chute. The Imperials quickly realized that the rebels were trapped in the garbage chute and proceeded to crush the chamber. Meanwhile, Threepio and R2-D2 narrowly escaped an Imperial patrol by claiming that the rebels had thrown them into the storage compartment. Once the Imperials had gone, the two droids were contacted by Skywalker, who ordered them to shut down the garbage compactor. R2-D2 succeeded in shutting down the garbage compactor just in time. However, amidst the muffled cries of joy over the comlink, Threepio initially believed that they had died. After grappling with more stormtroopers, the other rebels and the Princess managed to return to their hangar bay.

Master Kenobi shut down the tractor-beam projector but was cornered by his former apprentice, Darth Vader, on the way back. While Kenobi gave his life, C-3PO and the other rebels took the opportunity to flee the Death Star on the Millennium Falcon. After dispatching several pursuing TIE fighters, C-3PO and his companions escaped to the jungle moon of Yavin 4, where the rebels maintained a base. Using the Death Star plans stored in R2-D2's systems, the rebels discovered that the massive superweapon contained a weak point: an unprotected shaft. While Skywalker, R2-D2 and a Rebel strike force assailed the station, C-3PO remained with Princess Leia at the rebel command center on Yavin 4. Following the destruction of the Death Star, C-3PO was present at the victory parade where Skywalker, Solo, and two other rebel pilots including Wedge Antilles were awarded for their courageous actions.

Cymoon 1

"It appears the Millennium Falcon is being dismantled by native scavengers..."
"Well go out there and stop them!"
"Me? Go out..."
"There's a blaster in the cockpit! Do whatever you have to do! Threepio!?"
"Oh. Oh... dear."
―C-3PO and Han Solo
Several weeks after the Battle of Yavin, C-3PO was involved in the Assault on Cymoon 1. Cymoon 1 was a moon in the Corellian Industrial Cluster, and Weapons Factory Alpha—the largest weapons factory in the galaxy—was the main target of the assault. Chewbacca and 3PO piloted the Millennium Falcon through the debris fields that surrounded Cymoon 1, and landed in the huge refuse fields that fenced in the factory. Chewbacca left the relative safety of the Falcon and hiked towards the factory, while 3PO stayed behind to wait for the signal to begin the Falcon's autopilot when the team had achieved their objective of hacking into the main power core and rigging it to explode. The Falcon would swoop in and pick up Han, Leia, Luke, and R2 while Chewbacca covered their retreat from a large metal structure that overlooked the rendezvous escape point—before he too escaped aboard the freighter.

The team was posing as an envoy from Jabba the Hutt, due to Han's previous ties to the crime lord. Leia (who was disguised as one of the Hutt's bodyguards) contacted 3PO and Chewbacca via comlink and notified them that they were entering the factory. 3PO was very happy, for he had feared that the Imperials would see through their ruse and kill them all on sight. 3PO also noted that the tide of war seemed to be in their favor after the destruction of the Death Star—3PO had a "very good feeling about this." A short time later Leia and Han contacted 3PO and let the droid know that the plan had moved to phase two. Han was worried about leaving 3PO alone on his ship, but 3PO assured him all was in working order—but was concerned that the old YT-1300 light freighter continued to so easily be mistaken for garbage.

3PO received a comlink call several minutes later from Han, who told 3PO to start the autopilot so they could begin their escape. 3PO activated the autopilot—but nothing happened. About five minutes later Han again contacted the droid. 3PO told him what had happened. 3PO looked out of the transparisteel cockpit of the Falcon and noticed several scavengers dismantling the Falcon. Han ordered 3PO to take a blaster pistol and go stop them. But 3PO was unsure of himself—he was but a protocol droid programmed for translation and etiquette.

3PO didn't act for several minutes until Leia once again got in contact with him. She told the droid that they were going to die if the Falcon did not soon reach them. 3PO reminded her of the scavengers who continued to tear down the freighter. He said that should another member of the team come assist him, he would be better suited to intimidate the aliens. But Leia became angry and ordered the droid to "Do whatever you have to." 3PO gave in—for it was the House of Organa that he served. 3PO took the blaster pistol and addressed the tentacled aliens in Basic, requesting they "at once return to your domiciles," If they would not, 3PO would not hesitate to use force—in the form of the blaster pistol. The protocol droid fumbled and dropped the blaster, which fell at the feet of one creature. 3PO realized he'd made a mistake and surrendered. The creature examined it and shot 3PO in the chest. The super-heated gas did no real damage to 3PO's golden chest plate—but the kinetic energy of the blast blew off the droid's arms and legs. The aliens gathered up 3PO as Han called him and asked what he'd done to the Falcon. The droid asked if he could "close down for a while..." But due to the droid's injuries, Han was unable to hear the golden droid as he was carried off by the tentacled aliens.

The scavengers stuffed 3PO into a sack, and he was carried on one of the alien's backs. As a result of the attack, 3PO sustained a memory relapse and believed himself to be talking with Captain Antilles. He requested a peaceful diplomatic mission from "Antilles" before the alien he was strapped to was hoisted into the air and thrown by the mighty Chewbacca. Chewbacca blasted the other scavengers while 3PO confessed to "Antilles" that he cared for neither action or adventure. The aliens fled while the Wookiee went to work repairing the damage they had caused to the Falcon so he and the droid could go rescue the other team members, who were under attack by Darth Vader. 3PO heard through Chewbacca's comm, that Han and Leia were doomed. 3PO was just grateful his eye circuits were not connected so he wouldn't have to witness their deaths.

But they were not killed, for Chewbacca repaired the freighter, gathered up 3PO, and flew the Falcon to pick up the other team members. The Falcon fled into hyperspace as the golden droid admitted to "Antilles" that the mission had been the strangest diplomatic mission he'd ever experienced.

Within two days, the Millennium Falcon and its complement rendezvoused with the Rebel Fleet on the edge of the galaxy. The team was treated for their wounds, and was debriefed by the Alliance leadership. Threepio was completely repaired by Alliance engineers. Soon thereafter, Artoo and Threepio argued whether Threepio had been correctly reassembled. Luke and Artoo left the Rebel Fleet to return to Tatooine.

Nar Shaddaa

"Must I remind you of the trauma I experienced the last time we were here?"
"Gowwwarraaa…"
"You may have been the one Dengar electrocuted, but it was traumatic for me to witness."
―C-3PO and Chewbacca
Whilst on a mission to Nar Shaddaa, Threepio bore witness to a fight between Chewbacca and the bounty hunter Dengar.

Captured by SCAR Squadron and Rescued by R2-D2

During the Siege on Tureen VII, C-3PO was roaming the Harbinger looking for the hanger, but was captured by the notorious Task Force 99, also known as SCAR Squadron. He was later shown to Darth Vader who, despite having originally built the droid to help his mother and a reminder of his wife Padmé, told them to get rid of him, calling him useless junk. C-3PO had hope his friends would rescue him. In a chamber aboard a Star Destroyer, he was strapped down to a dismantling table, where he was reunited with R2-D2. After getting free, the pair made their way to the X-wing in the hanger bay and escaped the Star Destroyer. But not before Darth Vader chased them and with the help of Red Five, the Millennium Falcon, and the Volt Cobra, C-3PO escaped his captors and rejoined the rebels.

Escaping the Empire

"Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!"
―C-3PO, on Cloud City
Later, C-3PO and his rebel companions ended up on the icy planet of Hoth, where the Rebel Alliance maintained a secret base known as Echo Base. When Skywalker did not return from a patrol, Threepio and R2-D2 were deeply worried about the safety of their master. Han Solo departed on a tauntaun to rescue Skywalker, who had been attacked by a wampa. When R2-D2 calculated that Skywalker had a very poor chance of survival in the frozen wilderness, C-3PO tried to cheer up the others by assuring them that R2-D2 had been known to make mistakes from time to time. The following day, Skywalker and Solo were rescued by a Rebel patrol of snowspeeders.

While Skywalker recovered in the base hospital, C-3PO visited his master to wish him well. After Solo and Chewbacca encountered an Imperial probe droid, the Rebel Alliance ordered a mass evacuation of their Hoth base. While the Rebels' ion cannon and ground forces held back the advancing Imperial fleet and ground forces, Rebel transports began fleeing the Imperial blockade into hyperspace. During the Battle of Hoth, an Imperial ground invasion against the forces of Echo Base in the midst of the evacuation, Threepio fled through the halls with Solo and Organa, though he was eventually spotted by some of Vader's snowtroopers. Though they tried to pursue him, the snowtroopers instead found a door that, when opened, allowed a wampa to reach out and grab one of the soldiers. Unknown to them, the warning sign on this door had been ripped off. Sensing the rebels nearby, Vader led his troops after them as Threepio, Han, and Leia, unable to reach the transport they had been running to, made their way to Chewbacca and the Millennium Falcon to escape. When they were aboard, Vader, having deduced Solo would lead them to the Falcon, led his troops into the hangar, though one of the freighter's turrets fired on the invading troops before the ship, with C-3PO and the others safely aboard, blasted off. Nevertheless, Vader ordered Admiral Firmus Piett to catch the ship, believing he could use Luke Skywalker's friends to bring the young Jedi to him. In space, learning they were unable to enter hyperspace, the Falcon's crew fled into the Hoth asteroid belt to lose their Imperial pursuers.

The Millennium Falcon hid inside a deep cave, which turned out to be the innards of a giant space slug. While C-3PO and his fellow crew made repairs to the Falcon, they encountered several parasitic creatures called Mynocks. Following an earthquake, the crew of the Falcon fled the cave only to discover that they been hiding inside a space slug. Unable to jump into hyperspace, the Falcon feigned a frontal attack on an Imperial Star Destroyer and hid behind the rear of the vessel's command tower. When Threepio protested their plan was suicide, Princess Leia switched him off. After escaping the Imperial fleet, the Millennium Falcon fled to Cloud City, an orbital city in the gas giant of Bespin.

Cloud City was run by an old friend of Han Solo called Lando Calrissian, a former gambler and businessman. Upon landing, C-3PO attempted to greet Calrissian but was rudely brushed aside. While exploring Cloud City, he heard the familiar beep of an R2 unit only to stumble across several Imperial stormtroopers, who promptly disabled him with a stun blaster. The Imperials gave C-3PO's body parts to several Ugnaught garbage disposal workers, who attempted to dismantle him. However, Chewbacca arrived in the nick of time and rescued the protocol droid from being disintegrated. Soon thereafter, Threepio's rebel companions were betrayed by Calrissian, who handed them over to Darth Vader and the bounty hunter Boba Fett.

While imprisoned, Chewbacca was able to repair C-3PO's head, torso, and arms. Before he could reattach the protocol droid's legs, the rebels were summoned by Vader to a carbon-freezing chamber. There, Darth Vader intended to test Cloud City's carbon-freezing technology on Han Solo as part of his plot to lure Skywalker to Bespin. Despite initial fears that the process would kill Han, Threepio was mollified when he learned that Solo was merely hibernating. Vader then ordered Threepio and the remaining rebels to be taken to his flagship, the Super Star Destroyer Executor. However, Lando reneged on his deal with the Empire and freed C-3PO and his companions. Reuniting with R2-D2, C-3PO and his rebel companions fled Cloud City aboard the Millennium Falcon, but not before warning the city's inhabitants that the Empire was occupying their city.

On the way out, the rebels also rescued Luke Skywalker, who had lost his hand during a duel with Darth Vader. R2-D2 continued repairing Threepio aboard the Falcon but was forced to adjourn his repairs to fix the hyperdrive. After fixing the hyperdrive, the rebels escaped into hyperspace and linked up with the Rebel fleet.

Deliberation after escape

C-3PO fell witness to the argument between Leia, Lando, and Chewbacca following the group's escape from Cloud City. Upon Calrissian's remark that they had all lost something that day, Threepio remarked that he had lost his arms and legs, much to the others' annoyance. After the Falcon's return to the rebel fleet, Threepio, alongside Leia, discovered that the Empire had found a way to break the Rebellion's codes.

While with the fleet, Threepio, along with R2-D2 and Princess Leia visited Skywalker in the medical bay on a rebel ship. They watched out the window as Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca departed on the Falcon to rescue Solo from the bounty hunter Boba Fett.

Infected by the Scourge

During Scourge's takeover of droids across the galaxy, C-3PO was among those infected. While roaming Home One, he encountered his friend R2-D2. Under Scourge's influence he tricked the R2-unit into going to an airlock, he later ripped out the droid's communications and ejected the astromech out of the ship. He later made his way to Luke Skywalker startling him. He asked if droids can use the force. To save his friend, R2-D2 assembled a new D-Squad with WAC-47.

Rescuing Han Solo

Infiltrating the Palace

Later, C-3PO and his rebel companions learned that Han Solo was in the hands of the Hutt crime lord Jabba, who lived in a well-fortified desert palace on Tatooine. While Skywalker kept R2-D2 fully informed about his plans to rescue Solo, he kept Threepio in the dark because he knew of the protocol droid's inability to lie. C-3PO and R2-D2 traveled to Jabba's desert palace bringing a holographic message from Skywalker, who asked for Solo to be freed and offered the two droids as a gift. Jabba declined Skywalker's request and revealed that he had kept a carbonite Han on display as a trophy in his throne room. The two droids were dragooned in the Hutt crime lord's service; C-3PO ended up working as his translator, while R2-D2 was relegated to working as a waiter on Jabba's sail barge Khetanna.

Serving as Jabba's translator

"The mighty Jabba asks why he must pay 50,000."
"Ay yoto!"
"Because he's holding a thermal detonator!"
―C-3PO and "Boushh"
Later, Jabba was visited by Princess Leia, posing as the bounty hunter Boushh, who presented a captive Chewbacca. Unknown to Jabba, this was a ruse by Leia to infiltrate the castle and free Han from carbonite. Threepio served as a translator when Boushh and Jabba negotiated the sum for Chewbacca's bounty. After a near confrontation involving a thermal detonator, Jabba and Boushh reached a compromise sum. After Chewbacca was taken to Jabba's cells, Leia briefly spoke with C-3PO and commended him. That night, Leia freed Han from carbonite, only for both of them to be captured by Jabba and his minions.

The following day, Skywalker visited Jabba's palace and demanded that he free Han and his companions. Jabba refused and had Skywalker thrown down into his rancor pit. However, Skywalker killed the rancor, prompting an enraged Jabba to order that Skywalker, Solo, and Chewie be fed to the sarlacc that inhabited the Great Pit of Carkoon in the Dune Sea. Before Skywalker could be thrown to the beast, R2-D2 managed to pass his lightsaber to him. Following a struggle, the rebels killed Jabba and most of his entourage. During the fighting, C-3PO was attacked by Jabba's pet Kowakian monkey-lizard Salacious Crumb, who damaged one of his photoreceptors. R2-D2 rescued him. He and R2-D2 then dived into the Dune Sea. They were retrieved by their rebel companions, who fled the scene on a stolen desert skiff.

Battle of Endor

After rescuing Han Solo, C-3PO and his companions participated in a rebel mission to destroy the second Death Star that was being built above the Forest Moon of Endor. Through Bothan spies, the Rebel leadership had learned that Emperor Palpatine would be visiting the Death Star to oversee the final stages of its completion. In response, the Rebel leader Mon Mothma and Admiral Ackbar had marshaled the Rebel fleet for a massive strike against the Imperial leadership. Since the second Death Star was protected by a shield generator, a rebel force would have to infiltrate Endor and knock it out so that the Rebel fleet could destroy it.

C-3PO along with his companions R2-D2, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca took part in this Rebel mission to infiltrate Endor. Using a stolen Imperial shuttle, the rebels landed on Endor. They soon encountered several Imperial scout troopers, and Princess Leia was separated from the group during the struggle. C-3PO accompanied Han, Skywalker, and Chewbacca as they searched the forest for Leia. However, they stumbled into a trap laid by the Ewoks, a species of sentient furry bipeds native to Endor. The Ewoks had already befriended Leia and welcomed her as a guest. Believing that Threepio was a god, the Ewoks attempted to sacrifice Solo, Skywalker, Chewbacca, and Artoo. When Threepio failed to dissuade the Ewoks, Skywalker used the Force to cause Threepio's throne to levitate. Fearing that they had angered their god, the Ewoks promptly released their prisoners.

Later that night, C-3PO convinced the Ewoks to fight on the side of the Rebels against the Imperial presence on Endor. The following day, C-3PO and R2-D2 took part in the Rebel assault on the Death Star's shield generator. However, the rebel force was quickly captured by the Imperial garrison. C-3PO and R2-D2 managed to evade capture. Under orders from R2-D2, Threepio exposed his position to the Imperials. Shortly, the Ewoks attacked the Imperial forces massed outside the shield generator. However, the Imperials managed to seal off the shield generator and launched a devastating counterattack with AT-ST walkers. Meanwhile in space, the Rebel fleet was trapped between the Death Star and an Imperial fleet.

During the fighting, Threepio and R2-D2 made their way to the shield generator's blast door, where Han and Leia were attempting to breach it. R2-D2 attempted to access the power socket but was blasted by enemy fire, causing him to short-circuit. Threepio, Han, and Leia were then cornered by stormtroopers, but Leia managed to shoot them. Meanwhile, Chewbacca and two Ewok warriors turned the tide of the battle by hijacking an AT-ST walker and using it to destroy the others. Using the hijacked AT-ST, the rebels tricked the remaining Imperial troops into opening the shield generator. After storming the bunker, the rebels planted explosives, which destroyed the energy field protecting the Death Star. This enabled the Rebels to destroy the Death Star along with Emperor Palpatine, Darth Vader, and several Imperial ships. Following the Battle of Endor, Threepio took part in the victory celebrations at Bright Tree Village.

New Republic

Shattering the Empire

In the morning after the Battle of Endor, C-3PO was present at Bright Tree Village when Han Solo and the Pathfinders traveled to the far side of Endor to attack an Imperial outpost. Later, Threepio accompanied Han and Chewbacca on a raid on an Imperial Security Bureau black site at the Wretch of Tayron. After the Pathfinders secured the base, C-3PO accessed the Imperial data files and uncovered Operation: Cinder, a posthumous order by the Emperor to devastate various worlds following his demise.

Serving Senator Organa

"How many Centrist speakers have there been now?"
"Seventeen, all of whom addressed irregular protocol during the dedication ceremony. I must say, their attention to these points of etiquette seems . . . excessive."
―C-3PO was a member of Leia's senatorial staff
C-3PO continued serving Leia Organa following the Battle of Endor, and at some point, had his silver lower right leg replaced with a more gold one, becoming fully golden once more. The Rebel Alliance was transformed into the New Republic, which became the dominant galactic government following the Battle of Jakku and the Galactic Concordance. The Galactic Empire disintegrated with the remnants of the Empire retreating into the Unknown Regions, where they established the First Order. During the first years of the New Republic's rule, 3PO continued serving Leia, who was appointed head of the Senate Defense Council.

At some point during 9 ABY, Leia learned of a court martial hearing scheduled against General Hera Syndulla, who, despite direct orders from Senator Hamato Xiono, took off to investigate the destination of a rogue transport who had departed the Santhe Shipyards of Corellia carrying a Super Star Destroyer's hyperdrive core. Upon arriving at the transport's destination, Syndulla and her squadron led by Captain Carson Teva of the Adelphi Rangers discovered Morgan Elsbeth's massive hyperspace transport ring, the Eye of Sion, which Syndulla's friend Ahsoka Tano believed would be used to bring back Grand Admiral Thrawn from his exile on another galaxy. Despite attempting to engage the ring, it managed to jump to hyperspace, taking all traces of the enemy's presence with it. The deaths of New Republic pilots in an unsanctioned mission, as well as the lack of any evidence supporting Syndulla's claims led the Senate to dispatch three New Republic Defense Fleet cruisers to apprehend the General and bring her back to Coruscant for interrogation, leading Leia to discover the incident herself. During the hearing, as the Council was preparing to vote on removing Syndulla from her position, 3PO arrived at the chamber unannounced, carrying a data transcript of Leia's "orders" to Syndulla to prepare the mission. Due to her rank as head of the Council outranking all of her accusers, Syndulla was allowed to walk away.

About six years before the destruction of the Hosnian system, C-3PO served Senator Organa as an aide at the New Republic's senatorial complex on Hosnian Prime. Leia was a member of the Populists, one of the two main factions in the Galactic Senate. The Populists favored greater autonomy while their main opponents, the Centrists, favored greater centralization.

The protocol droid was present at a ceremony to dedicate a statue of Bail Organa, the late adopted father of Leia. The following day, Threepio attended a senatorial meeting where Senator Leia and a Centrist Senator named Ransolm Casterfo agreed to investigate the Nikto crime lord Rinnrivin Di's cartel, which was interfering with trade on Ryloth. When C-3PO reminded Leia that proper protocol dictated that a junior senator always be the one to call upon the senior senator, Leia, a senior senator, responded that she would ignore protocol and initiate contact.

Threepio accompanied Senator Organa, her entourage, and Senator Casterfo on Leia's personal starship Mirrorbright to the planet Bastatha, which was home to Rinnrivin's headquarters. Prior to the Organa and Casterfo's meeting with Magistrate Tosta and Xun, the protocol droid offered to record any conversations for posterity and assured them that he was fluent in seven million forms of communication. During the mission, Leia was kidnapped by Rinnrivin, who attempted to bribe the Senator, but was rescued by Casterfo.

After the Centrists passed a motion to create a new powerful office called First Senator, C-3PO encouraged his master Leia not to resign from the Senate. He was also present during a meeting of Populist senators when Leia reluctantly agreed to stand as the Populist nominee for First Senator. Later, the protocol droid ushered several visitors into Leia's office including a group of lobbyists from the Association of Small Craft Manufacturers, ore traders from Gad, several Populist senators from the Outer Rim, and the Senator Lady Carise Sindian for meetings with Leia. During the last meeting, Leia agreed to support Lady Carise's claim for the Supreme governorship of Birren due to her lack of interest in royal titles.

C-3PO later accompanied Senator Organa on a trip to Ryloth to search the Ryloth archives for information about Rinnrivin and his cartel. During the trip, Threepio greeted Emissary Yendor, whom he had first encountered during his time at Echo Base. The protocol droid recalled that the two had once worked together recalibrating the thermal units at the base precisely five days after they had arrived on Hoth. Yendor recalled working with C-3PO before entertaining Leia and her other staff members Korr Sella and Joph Seastriker. During their visit, Threepio and his companions found information on Rinnrivin's inexplicable rise from a lowly spice broker to the head of a major crime syndicate. They suspected that Rinnrivin was a front for other forces seeking to destabilize the New Republic.

Unmasking a conspiracy

"We're bringing Threepio?"
"We'll want to slice into the central computer core. That's not Threepio's speciality, but his programming is more than adequate for the task. There are other droids we could bring, but I'd rather stick with the one I know and trust."
"Okay, but even as old as he is, Threepio looks too nice for pilots as broke as we're supposed to be."
―Joph Seastriker and Senator Organa debating C-3PO's role in the Sibensko mission
After leaving Ryloth, Joph convinced a reluctant C-3PO to help him and Korr download information from one of Rinnrivin's satellites. As a result, they found that Rinnrivin was hiding on the Expansion Region world of Sibensko. After skipping Senator Varish Vicly's gala, C-3PO accompanied his master to Harloff Minor, where Leia arranged for a private meeting with Rinnrivin on neutral ground. While approaching Hosnian Prime, the protocol droid helped Senator Organa sift through her communiques, starting with the high-priority messages. One of these messages was from Senator Casterfo, who had been investigating a paramilitary group known as the Amaxine warriors on Daxam IV.

Later, C-3PO convinced Leia to delay her trip to Sibensko so that she could prepare for a Senate hearing on her nomination for First Senator. After an animated discussion, Leia accepted Threepio's advice and set the droid to work planning their trip. While Leia, her entourage, and Casterfo were planning their secret Sibensko trip, C-3PO pointed out that Leia's husband, Han Solo, was an occasional consumer of Port in a Storm, a popular beverage. Later, Greer treated C-3PO to an oil bath. After Leia's true parentage as Darth Vader's daughter was exposed during the Senate hearing, C-3PO received orders not to let anyone into Leia's office with the exception of close friends. He also prepared Leia's holocam for his master to send a heartfelt message to her son Ben Solo, who hitherto had been unaware of his true ancestry.

After Senator Organa obtained leave from the Senate, C-3PO aided her mission to Sibensko by slicing into the central computer core at the underwater city housing the Amaxine base. For that mission, Leia posed as an indentured servant of Joph and Greer Sonnel while Threepio pretended to be her guard. During the mission, C-3PO obtained banking records proving that the Amaxine Warriors and another mysterious entity were funnelling considerable funds into Rinnrivin's cartel. The protocol droid also discovered that the Amaxines had a large base in the underwater city. Leia instructed C-3PO to return with the data to Joph and Greer while she went to spy on the Amaxine base.

While Threepio left with Joph and Greer on their freighter, Leia headed into the Amaxine base only to be cornered by the Amaxines. She managed to escaped with Han on a racer before an explosion from a fallen starfighter destroyed the underwater city and the base, destroying much of the physical evidence linking the Amaxines and Rinnrivin's cartel. Despite this setback, Leia's tram succeeded in neutralizing a threat to the New Republic. Leia later presented the information from C-3PO's databanks to a special Senate hearing. While Leia was greeted with much hostility and disbelief, Senator Casterfo supported her by sharing evidence from his trip to Daxam IV.

Later, Threepio ushered in Senator Casterfo for a private audience with Leia. The two had fallen out after Casterfo had exposed Leia's true parentage at the instigation of Lady Carise, who was secretly working for the First Order. Casterfo had regained Leia's trust and respect after he had spoken in support of her during the recent Senate hearing. Having withdrawn her nomination for First Senator, Leia made preparations to resign from the Galactic Senate.

Resistance

Rescue of Admiral Ackbar

C-3PO found himself in the service of the Resistance, a military force founded by Leia Organa to combat the First Order. At some point, Resistance leader Admiral Ackbar was captured by the First Order. In an attempt to rescue Ackbar, the Resistance sent a team led by Captain Hoff. The team captured a First Order protocol droid named O-MR1, referred to as Omri, who was believed to know where Ackbar was. However, the ship carrying the team crashed on Taul before it could return to the Resistance base. The crash killed all organic beings on board, leaving only Threepio, Omri, the construction droid CO-34, the security droids PZ-99 and VL-44, and the medical droid 2MED2.

Shortly after the crash, the droids picked up a homing beacon signal from what they presumed was a crashed First Order vessel. Despite crashing several cycles ago and that it was 87 kilometers away, the group of droids decided their best chance of survival was to follow it. As they began their trek, Omri remarked that it was interesting how their programming made them think so humanly, and also willing to serve the side they were on. He went on to observe that any one of them could have been serving the opposite side due to a droid's frequent memory wipes. While on their way to the vessel, they were attacked by spice spiders. Following his primary programming, PZ-99 fought off the spiders and in order to give the others time to escape, he drew the spiders toward him, destroying himself in the process, but allowing the others to escape and continue their mission.

As they continued walking, Omri stated that he felt protocol droids such as he and Threepio were cursed to having their memories wiped, due to their need for an extra level of sentience. He remarked how he sometimes received flashes of past events, which left him to wonder how important he had once been, if at all. Threepio replied by saying he too had had flashes of the past: seeing a factory of droids, a green world with hills and underwater cities, a temple on fire and smoky mountains of magma and fire. Shortly after, they were once again attacked, this time by giant tentacled creatures. They began by ripping Toomedtoo apart and destroying CO-34. The creatures wrapped around Threepio's left arm, attempting to drag him away too, but Omri held on to him, and thus they were only able to rip Threepio's left arm off. Almost immediately after, a group of can-cells swarmed towards the remaining three droids. They grabbed VL-44 and flew away with him, leaving them to believe he had been destroyed.

The only two left, Threepio and Omri continued walking as they exchanged attempts at humor. The two expressed that they wished that they were on the same side. Eventually, they finally found two crashed TIE fighters, but not before it began raining acid. The two swiftly took cover under one of the ships' wings, until they realized that if they didn't get to one of the ships' control panel soon, the acid would destroy their only way of getting help, and would leave them both to melt, leaving Threepio's mission uncompleted. Omri told C-3PO that there was nothing in his directive telling him to prevent him from completing his mission and transferred Admiral Ackbar's location to him. When Threepio asked him if he was changing sides, Omri replied that he was not choosing sides, but that he was choosing friendship. With that, he started walking towards the ships' control panel in the acid rain, as he stated he would change the frequency to summon Threepio's master, so that at least he could survive. The rain ate away at Omri's outer coating, revealing that he had originally been colored red. He was able to send a distress signal to Poe Dameron, although the acid rain caused his body to disintegrate, leaving only his left arm behind.

After Dameron arrived and rescued C-3PO, Omri's left arm was used to replace Threepio's missing arm. Threepio told Dameron's astromech BB-8 that while his new arm offended his aesthetic sensibilities, he would keep it for a while to remember his fallen friends. Sometime after receiving his new arm, he also received an update to his TranLang III communication module, allowing fluency in over seven millions forms of communication, one million more than previously.

Operation: Sabre Strike

Following the successful Operation: Sabre Strike, C-3PO accompanied General Organa when she went to greet Poe Dameron and his fellow pilots Iolo Arana and Karé Kun. C-3PO complied with Organa's orders to examine the flight computers aboard the Hevurion Grace, the captured luxury yacht of the New Republic Senator Erudo Ro-Kiintor. While examining the computers, C-3PO confirmed General Organa's lingering suspicions that Senator Ro-Kiintor had indeed been secretly colluding with the First Order. In addition, the protocol droid found information relevant to Leia's quest to find her missing brother, Luke Skywalker. Using this information, General Organa sent Poe Dameron on a mission to find Lor San Tekka.

Aftermath of Ovanis

After the First Order learned about Black Squadron's secret mission to Ovanis, General Leia tasked C-3PO and his spy network with ferreting out the spy.

Mission to Kaddak

"I am indeed flattered, sir, as I am a mere protocol droid, and—"
"Shut up. You're my competition. We're both spymasters. You work for Organa and I work for Snoke. I know exactly who you are, and I know the kind of secrets you're carrying around in your memory unit. You're probably more valuable than Dameron."
―C-3PO and Terex
As General Organa's spymaster, C-3PO was charged with running the Resistance spy droid network. After the BX-series droid commando N1-ZX ("Nunzix") discovered purportedly valuable First Order intelligence on the crime haven world of Kaddak, General Organa tasked C-3PO with investigating the matter. Since they had lost contact with the droid, C-3PO visited Poe Dameron to request the Resistance starfighter pilot's help in traveling to Kaddak and retrieving the data. Under Organa's orders, C-3PO instructed Poe to bring himself and another pilot in a shuttle to avoid attracting attention. Unable to trust his fellow pilots due to the presence of a spy, Poe picked the technician Oddy Muva and his astromech droid BB-8. C-3PO and the team departed in a freighter.

Upon landing on Kaddak, C-3PO and the others witnessed a man being thrown to his death. While visiting a cantina on Level 45 of the Sliver, C-3PO commented about the presence of criminal factions and wished that his old friend, Han Solo were here. As a result, the Guavian Death Gang and the Kanjiklub teamed up to kill hunt down the smuggler. C-3PO also encountered a mouse droid who informed him that their spy droid had been captured by the Ranc Gang. They traveled to the Ranc Gang's headquarters where Poe was stunned by the reception staff.

C-3PO, Oddy, and BB-8 were surrounded by several gangsters, who wanted to take Poe and destroy them. C-3PO outmaneuvered the gangsters by activating several droid spies, who forced the gang to stand down. The droids also rescued N1-ZX. Despite C-3PO's orders, N1-ZX refused to release the information he was carrying until he was safely returned to the Resistance base due to his embedded self-preservation programming. Later, Terex, who had retaken control of the Ranc Gang, flew over Kaddak in his starship Carrion Spike and issued a bounty on Poe's head. With the help of BB-8, Poe activated several Resistance droid spies, who proceeded to block the mob. Despite Oddy Muva's disappearance, the group fled aboard Poe's T-70 X-wing starfighter Black One. C-3PO and N1-ZX hid in consoles that were built into the fighter's S-foils.

After fleeing into space, Poe asked C-3PO if he had any luck contacting Oddy Muva. C-3PO apologized that he had not. Poe decided to get N1-ZX back to the Resistance base. C-3PO remarked that he regarded traveling through hyperspace while attached to a starship as a nightmarish experience. Regarding Kaddak as "bad news," C-3PO opined that he hoped that Master Muva was not in any sort of danger. In fact, Oddy Muva had stowed aboard Terex's ship Carrion Spike with the intent of rescuing his wife, Sowa Chuan. Terex had blackmailed Muva into spying on the Resistance using his wife as a hostage.

During the hyperspace journey, Poe confided in C-3PO his suspicions that there was a spy among their ranks. Poe ruled out General Organa and his Black Squadron mates. C-3PO vouched for General Organa and reassured Poe that she was not a traitor. Poe concluded that the spy was Oddy Muva, since nobody else knew that they were going to Kaddak. Poe decided that they could not risk bringing Nunzix back to D'Qar and told C-3PO to wake him up. C-3PO complied, and Poe questioned N1-ZX about the data he was carrying. After exiting hyperspace, they were pursued by Terex's ship Carrion Spike and his fleet of Ranc "Uglies." Poe's X-wing was hit and crash-landed on a desert planet.

C-3PO and the others survived the crash, but Nunzix's right arm was severed. The droids and Poe fled into a cave to escape Terex's "Uglies." Terex soon led a landing party into the cave. BB-8 tried to delay the Ranc Gang by crashing a stalactite on top of the intruders. After BB-8 was shot down, C-3PO volunteered to stay behind in order to slow down the Ranc Gang so that Poe and N1-ZX could retreat. He reassured Poe that he was expendable and could be rebuilt. When Terex and his gang arrived, C-3PO used his knowledge of languages to summon the fjor-bats in the cave to harry the pirates, claiming they had come to steal their younglings. Terex retaliated by shaking C-3PO's right leg off. Having found his equivalent spymaster, Terex stole C-3PO's memory unit, disabling the droid.

In C-3PO's absence, Black Squadron arrived to rescue Poe and fought Terex's criminal fleet in space. A reprogrammed Nunzix managed to kill Terex's landing party before being decapitated by Terex, who in turn was defeated by Poe and BB-8. Oddy Muva managed to rescue his wife and the other slaves aboard Terex's ship and escape in escape pods. First Order forces under Commander Malarus subsequently arrived and destroyed Terex's fleet. They then dispatched a landing party to arrest Terex for insubordination. Poe dragged the inactive C-3PO and the defeated Terex out of the cave. Poe allowed Malarus to arrest Terex.

Tracking BB-8

In 34 ABY, C-3PO was stationed aboard the same CR90 corvette as Organa, speaking over the intercom for Dameron, who was joined by New Republic pilot Kazuda Xiono, to immediately report to the general after he returned from a mission to retrieve vital intelligence. Shortly before the Battle of Starkiller Base, C-3PO had neglected to turn on BB-8's tracking device before the droid went on a vital mission to Jakku with Poe Dameron. When the droid went missing, Threepio alerted the droid spynet to keep an eye out for BB-8.

When BB-8 was found on Takodana with Han Solo and Finn, C-3PO was part of the Resistance team that arrived to pick them up. As Han Solo was reunited with Leia, C-3PO interrupted them before they had the chance to speak to each other, eagerly introducing himself, stating that Solo must not recognize him because of the red arm. Not realizing they had already seen each other, Threepio went to re-introduce Leia, before noticing he had ruined the moment. Threepio then decided it was best to leave them to talk to each other, walking off with BB-8, who asked him if he must get his proper arm reinstalled, and he replied "Yes."

After returning to Resistance Base on D'Qar, C-3PO found BB-8 observing R2-D2, who had been in self-imposed low power mode ever since Luke went into hiding. Threepio told him it was no use trying to wake him up, and it was very unlikely he would have the rest of the map to find Luke Skywalker stored in his backup data. Shortly after the Battle of Starkiller Base, R2-D2 awoke from his low-power mode, discovering he indeed had the map to Skywalker, to Threepio and BB-8's excitement and shock. Before Rey left to travel to the system they had found Luke Skywalker on, Threepio had replaced his left arm, and now once again sported golden plating.

Evacuation of D'Qar

"Wipe that nervous expression off your face, Threepio."
"Oh. Well, I will certainly try, General. [...] Nervous?"
―Leia Organa and C-3PO, during the Evacuation of D'Qar
After the successful attack on Starkiller Base, the Resistance lowered their guard at the Resistance base, expecting they weren't going to live out the day. However, as they resumed their activities, C-3PO received a transmission, which depicted the First Order Navy regrouping, causing him to urgently contact Organa and inform her to go to the command center as soon as she could. When asked by Organa how much time they had before the First Order's arrival, Threepio answered that it was very little and that they would be there before they knew it. Realizing that the base was unshielded and that if the First Order brought enough firepower the base would be destroyed, Organa ordered the Resistance's evacuation. During the evacuation, Threepio was on the bridge of the flagship, Raddus.

Attack on the Resistance fleet

"Sir, I am almost afraid to ask—"
"Good instinct, Threepio. Go with that."
―C-3PO, to Poe Dameron
After escaping the First Order at D'Qar, the Resistance was ambushed by the First Order flagship, Supremacy, as well as several Resurgent-class Star Destroyers. During this time, Threepio was still on the Raddus, but not on the bridge.

Threepio was present on the secondary bridge when Vice-Admiral Amilyn Holdo was named the new commander of the fleet, expressing concern when informed that all Resistance senior leadership on the bridge save Leia had perished in the attack. Threepio spent time watching over Leia as she recovered from her injuries. Threepio and was present in the medical bay when Poe sent Finn and Rose Tico on a secret mission to the casino at Canto Bight. Threepio warned Dameron that Holdo would never authorize their plan.

Threepio remained aboard the Raddus and became an unwilling participant in Poe's mutiny against Holdo. Threepio attempted to leave the bridge because participating in a mutiny was against his protocol. Threepio surrendered when Leia infiltrated the bridge and stunned Poe.

Escaping the First Order

"Sir, it is possible that a natural unmapped opening exists. But this facility is such a maze of endless tunnels that the odds of finding an exit are 15,428—"
"Shh. Shush. Hush. Shush up. Shut up!"
"To one."
"Listen."
"My audio sensors no longer detect the—"
"Exactly."
―C-3PO and Poe Dameron
Per Holdo's plan to allow the Resistance to survive, Threepio boarded a cloaked U-55 orbital loadlifter bound for the planet Crait along with the other surviving Resistance fighters. The Resistance planned to use an abandoned Rebel hideout on the planet to send a signal for help to the Outer Rim. Owing to Holdo's sacrifice, Threepio's transport was one of the six that survived the First Order's attack and reached the planet's surface safely.

On Crait, Threepio interpreted BB-8's analysis of the mine's schematics, determining that the massive bunker door was the only way in or out of the base. After the Resistance's attack run on the First Order's siege cannon failed and the bunker door was breached, Threepio witnessed a projection of Luke Skywalker emerge from the shadows of the base. A shocked Threepio was only able to say the legendary Jedi's name, and Luke winked at him in response.

Shortly after, Threepio realized that his audio sensors could no longer detect the vulptices, and along with the rest of the Resistance, he followed Poe to an unmapped natural opening, blocked by boulders, that the wildlife of Crait used to access the base. Threepio looked on as Rey used the Force to move the boulders out of the way, allowing the Resistance to escape on board the Falcon, where Threepio was reunited with R2-D2.

Aboard the Falcon

Following the Battle of Crait and having escaped from the First Order aboard the Falcon, C-3PO found R2-D2 and BB-8 talking in a hallway. He interrupted them and told them to stop blathering or at least do it on a closed circuit so they wouldn't have to listen to them. He commented about the heavy losses of the Battle of Starkiller Base and told the two droids he was involved in a very important project and they were making it extremely difficult for him to concentrate. As the two droids departed, C-3PO told Rey, who was reading one of the Jedi Order's sacred texts, that he had dealt with the droids and they wouldn't bother them any further before asking her where they had gone.

Rey asked C-3PO to translate a paragraph in one of the books. Finding the translation initially a bit difficult due to the fact the language used was unusual, Threepio took the book and translated the text, leading Rey to comment that she liked the passage and that it was a lovely place to begin. Later, upon receiving a transmission from Black Squadron from one of their relay stations, C-3PO went to report the transmission to Dameron and Finn, to which Dameron explained to Finn that they just needed to have a little faith. However, due to Dameron's excitement over the news, C-3PO reported that Dameron needed to listen to the message as he wouldn't call it good news.

Time on Anoat and mission to Mon Cala

Threepio was present at the Resistance Camp on the garbage planet of Anoat when Leia Organa decided to go and seek aid from the inhabitants of Mon Cala. C-3PO later travelled to Mon Cala along with Rose, Rey, and Chewbacca to convince its people to support aid for the Resistance. When they arrived, however, they were confronted by Nossor Ri and others. They were soon greeted by Ackbar's son Aftab. While Leia went to speak to Mon Cala's king, C-3PO remained behind at the Falcon when he and the others were attacked by representives. He was later captured and placed in a pod and was brought before the king.

Defeating the First Order

"If this mission fails, it was all for nothing. All we've done. All this time."
"What're you doing there, Threepio?"
"Taking one last look, sir… at my friends."
―C-3PO, to Poe Dameron and his other friends, before having his memory wiped
C-3PO and the Resistance eventually established themselves on the jungle world of Ajan Kloss. After learning of the return of Darth Sidious and that he was based on the planet Exegol, which R2 and him stated was not on any star map, C-3PO travelled with Rey, Finn, Chewbacca, and Poe Dameron to Pasaana on their mission to find a Sith wayfinder, where they encountered C-3PO and Chewbacca's old friend Lando Calrissian. During his time on Passanna the group recovered the Blade of Ochi of Bestoon, a Sith dagger. While C-3PO was able to translate the writings on the Sith dagger, his programming prevented him from being able to reveal the translation to anyone.

The group travelled to Kijimi, where the droidsmith Babu Frik was able to determine how to bypass C-3PO's programming restrictions, but said doing so would cause C-3PO to undergo a complete memory wipe. C-3PO willingly allowed Frik to perform the procedure, believing that this would result in the permanent loss of his memories as he didn't think R2-D2 had a backup of his memory. C-3PO's photoreceptors turned red while he translated the Sith writings on the dagger. After completing the translation C-3PO rebooted, and his memory was wiped in the process, leaving him to restart with his basic factory programming.

Upon the group's return to Ajan Kloss, it turned out that R2-D2 had backed up C-3PO's memories. R2-D2 was able to restore his counterpart's memories from that backup. During the Battle of Exegol, the Resistance, joined by the Citizens' Fleet gathered by Calrissian and Chewbacca, defeated the Sith Eternal forces and inspired a galactic uprising against the First Order. When the Resistance and civilian fleet gathered at Ajan Kloss, C-3PO was with R2 when Rey landed aboard Red Five. When he heard the X-wing's approach, he asked R2 if he heard the same, the very same question he had asked his astromech droid friend decades earlier above Tatooine.

Reflecting on the past

At some point, C-3PO was able to recover at least some of the memories he lost in 19 BBY, including how he had been built by Anakin Skywalker, the story around the Invasion of Naboo, and how he met R2-D2 in 32 BBY. One day, C-3PO introduced himself, R2-D2, and BB-8 to another party, explaining in the process they had gone through many adventures and remarking that their missions had impacted the fate of the galaxy on several occasions. Agreeing with R2-D2 that their adventures were rarely easy, C-3PO was asked by BB-8 how he had met R2-D2 in the first place, to which C-3PO began to explain the story around the Naboo Crisis, which he promised would be fascinating.

Beginning the story by explaining the Republic Era and how the greedy Trade Federation had launched a blockade against the world of Naboo, C-3PO introduced BB-8 to Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, explaining how they represented the peace and just-upholding Jedi Order, whereas he had much less kind things to say about the Federation. Continuing the story and revealing the role Darth Sidious had played in the blockade and how he ordered the deaths of both Jedi, something that scared BB-8, C-3PO questioned how a droid could be programmed for murder as he relayed the deployment of Federation battle droids against the Jedi, then assured BB-8 that the protocol droid TC-14 was unaffected by the dioxis gas Viceory Gunray pumped into the room where Jinn and Kenobi were kept waiting. As he relayed the Jedi duo's fight towards the vessel's control bridge, R2-D2 spoke up, expressing how much he wanted to own a lightsaber, something C-3PO admitted he was happy had not come to pass.

After Jinn and Kenobi had been rerouted and decided to sneak down to the surface in C-9979 landing craft, and after C-3PO needed to interrupt the tale again to assure BB-8 the small droid was also skilled at hiding on ships, C-3PO introduced Jar Jar Binks, whom he claimed had rambled as much as R2-D2, to which R2-D2 countered that C-3PO was the one rambling. While annoyed, C-3PO continued after asking R2 to quiet down and admitted Binks was not the most useful of guides, with the Jedi duo's journey bringing them from the Gungan city to the Naboo planet core, where a colo claw fish tried to devour their Tribubble bongo submarine, much to C-3PO's confusion as he did not know why an animal would want to eat such a vessel. Nonetheless, he carried on, continuing all the way to the Jedi duo's escape from Naboo with Queen Amidala and her entourage; the destruction of so many battle droids during the event upset both C-3PO and BB-8, but C-3PO assured BB-8 they had been "bad droids" who followed orders to hurt people, whereas the three of them tried to help others.

As C-3PO continued the story with the escape of the Royal Naboo Starship into space, he introduced R2-D2's role in the event as he had repaired parts of the damaged vessel. While it was R2-D2's favorite part of the tale, C-3PO remarked that he was not sure why Amidala was so pleased with R2-D2, as he had not repaired the entire ship. C-3PO continued the tale with the group's journey to Tatooine, where he and R2-D2 finally met in the home of the young Anakin and his mother, Shmi Skywalker. C-3PO also took time to explain how worlds in the Outer Rim were able to ignore Republic anti-slavery laws and was annoyed by R2-D2's recollection of his lack of plating. Confessing that he thought Sebulba the podracer was better at cheating than he was racing, C-3PO relayed the role of the Boonta Eve Classic in the tale next, growing annoyed with how Sebulba cheated and promising BB-8 he had more stories to come about the gangster Jabba the Hutt, who had overseen the race. Following Anakin's victory, C-3PO relayed his departure from Tatooine, promising BB-8 he would see why it was so important for Skywalker to become a Jedi, even if it was sad for his mother Shmi.

After detailing Jinn's duel against the Sith Lord Darth Maul in the Tatooine desert and the first between Skywalker and Kenobi, both of which R2-D2 interrupted with his own commentary, C-3PO introduced BB-8 to the planet Coruscant and the Jedi prophecy of the Chosen One, who Jinn believed Skywalker to be. Following the Galactic Senate's Vote of No Confidence in Supreme Chancellor Valorum, which played a vital role in then-Senator Palpatine's rise to power, C-3PO explained the team's return to Naboo and asked R2-D2 to take heed of Jinn's advice to watch and be mindful of the moment. Pleased with Amidala's cleverness in how she had switched places with her handmaiden Sabé, C-3PO relayed how the native Gungans and the Naboo had allied together to oust the occupying Trade Federation, further promising BB-8 that the frightening Darth Maul would be dealt with by the story's end. As the Gungans fought the Trade Federation Droid Army in the Great Grass Plans, the Naboo had made their way to the capital of Theed and scaled the side of the Royal Palace with ascension guns, with C-3PO informing BB-8 he had no idea where the small droid could find such a weapon and that he was happy for it.

As C-3PO relayed the story of the Gungan army's retreat from the Droid Army, something he did not blame them for, he revealed the entire army was shut down when Skywalker—aboard an N-1 starfighter with R2, whom C-3PO was shocked had allowed such a reckless event to take place—destroyed the Droid Control Ship in orbit. All the same, C-3PO claimed he would never forgive R2-D2 for endangering their young master in the battle by flying with him and disagreed with BB-8's assessment that the event was an exciting adventure. Promising to stop if BB-8 found the story too scary, C-3PO then relayed Jinn and Kenobi's duel with Maul, which ended with Jinn dead at Maul's hands and Maul himself cut in half by Kenobi, with the defeated Sith tumbling into a pit below. C-3PO commended Kenobi for his abilities and also assured BB-8 that a deceased Jedi would pass into the Force, meaning they were not truly gone. Finishing his tale by explaining how Kenobi took Skywalker as his Padawan and the Jedi Order's fears about the remaining Sith Lord, explaining to BB-8 the idea behind the Rule of Two in the process, C-3PO concluded the tale with the post-invasion celebration through Theed and promised BB-8 that Skywalker would then begin a journey that changed the galaxy forever. Wrapping up, C-3PO admitted the tale had been excited and was eager to share more about their lives to BB-8, promising him the Naboo Crisis had only been the beginning of the tale.

Characteristics

"It's all right, sir. I'm only a droid. I am expendable. I can always be rebuilt. You, however, cannot."
"I don't know how things got to this point, Threepio... but thank you."
―C-3PO and Poe Dameron
C-3PO was known for his polite, fastidious, and worry-prone personality. As a droid, he exhibited much loyalty and commitment to his masters and sought to serve them to his best ability. Throughout his operational life, C-3PO worked diligently for several masters including Anakin Skywalker, Padmé Amidala, Bail Organa, and Luke Skywalker. As a protocol droid, C-3PO could communicate in over seven million different forms of communication. This allowed him to communicate with computer systems including those on the Millennium Falcon. Pit droid WAC-47 found C-3PO to be a "handsome fella."

Unlike his best friend and astromech counterpart, R2-D2, C-3PO liked to stick to routine and did not respond well to change. When placed in danger, C-3PO had a tendency to panic as shown on several occasions, including infiltrating a droid foundry on Geonosis and a mission to steal Imperial disruptors on Lothal. Despite his loyalty and commitment, C-3PO was generally unable to lie or to keep secrets due to his programming. In fact, after the Hijacking of the Harbinger, during which Task Force 99 captured him, they remarked to Darth Vader that they were unable to get him to shut up. Despite the droid's talkative nature, he was able to keep Anakin and Padmé's marriage secret. C-3PO's inability to lie came at a disadvantage when he and his companions were captured by Ewoks prior to the Battle of Endor. Due to his general inability to keep secrets, Bail Organa arranged for him to receive a memory wipe in order to preserve the secret of Anakin and Padmé's offspring, Luke and Leia.

Threepio's programming, focused on etiquette and protocol, impacted his personality and limited his behavior in several other ways. On Endor, he found it difficult to impersonate a deity due to his programming, and during the attack on the Resistance fleet, he attempted to leave a mutiny in progress because it was not correct protocol. Even though his master Anakin Skywalker had taken part in the sport, C-3PO believed that podracing did not sound like a fun time. He also thought of B1-series battle droids as "bad droids" who only followed hurtful orders, whereas droids like himself, BB-8, and, even if it took him some prompting to admit, R2-D2 tried to help people. Still, he took the moment to take a jab at R2-D2, claiming his counterpart helped people "from time to time." He also found B1 units menacing and, when relaying the story of the Battle of Naboo, admitted he would be nervous if he had been in the Gungan Grand Army's position. Nonetheless, he admitted to BB-8 he found stories like the Invasion of Naboo a tad upsetting because so many droids, even if they were "bad droids," had be to destroyed. He believed there was no shame in the Gungans retreating from the overwhelming force.

C-3PO continued serving Leia Organa in her careers as New Republic senator and subsequently Resistance General. C-3PO managed General Organa's Resistance droid spy network. Despite not being able to run or fight, C-3PO bravely stayed behind to hold back the First Order Agent Terex so that Poe Dameron and the spy droid N1-ZX could flee deeper into the caves. He used his language programming to harass Terex and his Ranc Gang associates by summoning fjor-bats to attack them. C-3PO quipped that he was expendable and could be rebuilt.

Equipment

"You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm."
―C-3PO
C-3PO was a 3PO-series protocol droid, who stood at a height of 1.77 meters and weighed 75 kilograms. He had a masculine programming and had experienced at least two memory wipes throughout his operational life. While C-3PO's chassis was originally covered in gray plating, he was largely covered in golden plating by the time of the Clone Wars. As a protocol droid specializing in human and cyborg communications, C-3PO could speak six million different forms of communication, including Ewokese.

By the time of the Cold War, C-3PO's TranLang III communication module had been upgraded, allowing him to speak in seven million forms of communication. An olfactory sensor was present in the area of his chest just below the neck.

Behind the scenes

Concept and creation

George Lucas based C-3PO and R2-D2 off Tahei and Matashichi, two characters in one of his major inspirations, the 1958 film The Hidden Fortress. His 1973 story treatment included two bickering "imperial bureaucrats" (not stated to be robots) as comic relief characters.

Portrayal

"It just struck me because I looked at its face and the face looked back at me and we had this extraordinary eye contact. […] He seemed to be saying: 'Come, come. Be with me,' and the vulnerability in his face made me want to help him."
―Anthony Daniels, on his first impression of C-3PO
Anthony Daniels, C-3PO's portrayer, met George Lucas in 1975. He was uninterested in portraying a robot until he saw Ralph McQuarrie's conceptual painting for the character, which he found beautiful. When filming the movie, Daniels wrote out what he imagined R2-D2 was saying to help him get through a scene. In a deleted scene for Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, C-3PO was guided through Jabba's Palace by a character referred to as "Lightman" by the production.

During filming of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, Industrial Light & Magic Chief Model maker Michael Lynch built a puppet that was used to portray C-3PO's unfinished appearance, with Daniels providing the character's voice. C-3PO was animated by Lynch acting as a puppeteer dressed in a full-color suit, at times on-set with the other actors and at others filmed against a green screen. Daniels remained off-camera and delivered the lines, guiding Lynch's movements as he brought the puppet to life.

Daniels attempted to puppeteer the character himself in the sequel, Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, but after the script was changed, he returned to playing the droid in costume. In this film and 2005's Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, he also performed the vocal tracks for scenes that featured a computer-generated C-3PO. In Attack of the Clones, the script called for Padmé Amidala to complete C-3PO's outer casing with pieces she found from the Lars garage, thereby addressing the plot point from The Phantom Menace that Anakin Skywalker never finished it. To puppeteer C-3PO's "naked" form before getting his outer casing, Daniels wore a custom harness and could ensure the character walked more like he did when in full costume. The puppet-based C-3PO was filmed, but it was eventually decided that the outer casing plot point could be fulfilled offscreen, which allowed C-3PO to appear in full costume earlier. Reshoots for the rewritten scene occured at Ealing Studios and at ILM.

Daniels reprised the role of C-3PO in Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens. J.J. Abrams initially asked if he only wanted to supply the voice due to his age, but Daniels was happy to wear the costume again. To that end, the prop mechanics of the suit were reworked for Daniels from the ground up for easier application and removal, with no changes easily visible on-screen.

At least one appearance of the gold-plated protocol droid, however, did not feature Daniels in the suit; for C-3PO's brief cameo in the first episode of 2022's Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi, the droid was performed by creature artist Chris Bartlett. His dialogue, however, was once again supplied by Daniels.

Continuity

Although the Encylopedia on StarWars.com listed C-3PO's height as 1.71 meters, subsequently published reference books, including Star Wars Rebels: Head to Head, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, and Star Wars: Extraordinary Droids started that C-3PO was 1.77 meters tall.
